LoLFantasyBot
=============

This Reddit bot monitors [/r/LeagueOfLegends](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends) for post-game discussion threads.  Upon finding a thread, the bot requests game information from [LoLESports](http://www.lolesports.com/) and replies to the thread with a fantasy impact table for that game. The bot also has the ability to make its own threads once the game has been completed rather than replying to existing ones, this functionality is heavily used in [/r/FantasyLCS](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasylcs).
