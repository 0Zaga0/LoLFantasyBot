# LoLFantasyBot

#### NOTICE: The API used in this project is no longer available.

## Purpose

This Reddit bot monitored [/r/LeagueOfLegends](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends) for post-game discussion threads.  Upon finding a thread, the bot would pull match information from [LoLESports](http://www.lolesports.com/) and reply to the thread with a fantasy impact table for that game. The bot also has the ability to make its own threads once the game has been completed rather than replying to existing ones, as previously used in [/r/FantasyLCS](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasylcs).
